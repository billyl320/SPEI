# SPEI
Shape proportion and encircled image-histogram code.  Requires code from "Image Operators: Image Processing in Python" by Dr. Jason M. Kinser.  Specifically, it needs mgcreate's Plop function.  


## convert.py 
Provides the main functions to perform SPEI.  Also has supporting functions to perform SPEIs of images in in multiple directories.  
             
## single_ultima.py
Example of performing SPEI on square image.  

## dir_ultima.py 
Example of how to perform SPEI on group of images in a directory. May need to be changed for given problem. For example, if user does not want to use Otsu thresholdingas a preprocessing step, other functions will need to be changed to accomodate this.
